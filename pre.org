#+BEGIN_NOTES
Let's start with a situation.

***** The problem: Your connection is not private

For example, [[https://138.2.115.37/buy/5][this site]].

#+BEGIN_NOTES
I guess most of you have encountered a situation like this before: you enter a URL in your browser to open a website, but the browser tells you that the connection is not secure. Why does the browser think that the website is not secure?

Certificate is not valid.

But what is a certificate?

#+BEGIN_NOTES
If you click here, the browser will tell you that "Certificate is not valid." But what does "Certificate is not valid" mean? What is a certificate?
#+END_NOTES

#+BEGIN_NOTES
This is my topic. I'll try to explain what is a certificate, explain why some websites don't have certificates and what risks can be associated with accessing these sites.
#+END_NOTES

**** asymmetric encryption

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Certificates is to solve some issues in asymmetric encryption. Therefore, I will first provide a brief introduction to asymmetric encryption.
#+END_NOTES

***** Why do we need encryption?


[[file:img/Pasted_image_20230618201349.png]]


Why do we need encryption? Because the Internet is not secure at all.

Let's assume that the two parties communicating are Alice and Bob, and Eve is a malicious third party trying to eavesdrop on their communication.

Before Alice sends a message to Bob, she encrypts the message to create ciphertext. Bob decrypts the ciphertext to obtain the message after receiving it.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Why do we need to encrypt data? Because the internet is not safe at all. transmitting plain text poses a risk of being intercepted, tampered and discarded. For example, you probably don't want someone else to eavesdrop on your Alipay password, right?

For the purpose of this discussion, let's assume that the two parties communicating are Alice and Bob, and Eve is a malicious third party trying to eavesdrop on their communication.

Before Alice sends a message to Bob, she encrypts the message to create ciphertext. Bob decrypts the ciphertext to obtain the message after receiving it. just as illustrated in this picture.

***** symmetric encryption

Symmetric encryption: encrypt and decrypt data with the same key, so the sender and receiver have the same key.

The problem of symmetric encryption: how to transfer a key safely? That's the motivation for asymmetric encryption.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Before asymmetric encryption was introduced, there was only symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt data. This key is shared between the sender and receiver. The problem is that, the secret key can be difficult to be distributed over a public network, such as the internet, because your secret key can be eavesdrop and become not secret any more. And that's the motivation of asymmetric encryption.
#+END_NOTES

***** Asymmetric encryption
Asymmetric encryption uses key pairs for encryption and decryption. key pair=(public key, private key).

The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption. Public key should be shared with senders, secret key shouldn't be told anyone.

[[file:img/Pasted_image_20230619093338.png]]

Even if Eve intercepts public keys of Alice and Bob, it doesn't matter because public keys are used for encryption not decryption. Eve cannot intercept private keys because private keys will never be sent.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Asymmetric encryption uses key pairs for encryption and decryption. A key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is used for encryption, and the private key is used for decryption. Public key should be shared with senders, secret key shouldn't be told anyone.

As shown in this picture, if Alice wants to receive a message from Bob, she sends him her public key, but never her private key. Before Bob sends a message to Alice, he encrypts it using Alice's public key, and Alice decrypts it using her private key. Even if Eve eavesdrops on the encrypted message, she can't decrypt it without Alice's private key. Similarly, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she needs to obtain Bob's public key first.

Even if the public key is intercepted by Eve, it doesn't matter because public key can only be used for encryption and not decryption. Eve doesn't have Alice.
#+END_NOTES

#+REVEAL: split

In asymmetric encryption, there's no need to distribute the private key, and there's no need to worry about the public key being intercepted.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Therefore, in asymmetric encryption, there's no need to distribute the private key, and there's no need to worry about the public key being intercepted.

Asymmetric encryption still poses a potential risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Asymmetric encryption poses a potential risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. Let me give an example to illustrate this point.
#+END_NOTES

***** example

#+RESULTS:

#+BEGIN_NOTES
It is supposed to be that Alice sends her public key to Bob, and Bob sends his public key to Alice.

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

[[file:img/Pasted_image_20230618210943.svg]]

#+BEGIN_NOTES
But now there is a man in the middle Eve. When Alice sends her public key to Bob, Eve intercepts Alice's message and obtains Alice's public key, then Eve sends her own public key to Bob. Similarly, when Bob sends his public key to Alice, Eve intercepts Bob's message, obtains Bob's public key, and sends her own public key to Alice. Alice thinks she is communicating with Bob, and Bob thinks he is communicating with Alice, but in fact, they are both communicating with Eve.
#+END_NOTES

***** the problem

When you receive a public key claiming to be Alice's, how can you make sure it is actually Alice's public key and not the public key of a man-in-the-middle attacker?

That's when certificates come into play.

#+END_NOTES

**** CA and digital certificates
***** certificate
certificate=subject's public key+digital signature of CA (Certificate Authority)

Digital signatures ensure the authenticity of the content of the certificate.

The certificate proves that Alice's public key is indeed hers.

Just like driver's license.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Technically, certificates consist of the subject's public key and the issuer's digital signature.

The digital signature is another important concept in asymmetric cryptography. Here we only need to know that with a digital signature, Bob can be sure that the certificate is issued by a trusted CA and the contents are trustworthy, rather than being forged by Eve.

The certificate proves that Alice's public key is indeed hers.

A very appropriate analogy is a driver's license. Just as the transportation department issues a driver's license to prove a driver's qualifications, a CA issues a certificate to ensure the authenticity of the public key.

As shown in this image, the CA issues a certificate that contains Jane Doe's public key and a digital signature from the CA.
#+end_notes
***** now
Now instead of sending public keys, they send their own certficates.

#+begin_src d2 :file ../vx_attachments/Pasted_image_20230618230110.svg :exports none
style.fill: transparent
direction: right
Alice->Bob: Alice's certificate
Bob->Alice: Bob's certificate
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 45% :align center
[[file:img/Pasted_image_20230618230110.svg]]

Even if Eve intercepts the certificates, she can do nothing.
#+begin_src d2 :file ../vx_attachments/Pasted_image_20230618230134.svg :exports none
style.fill: transparent
direction: right
Alice -> Eve: Alice's certificate
Eve -> Bob: Alice's certificate
Bob -> Eve: Bob's certificate
Eve -> Alice: Bob's certificate
#+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 45% :align center
[[file:img/Pasted_image_20230618230134.svg]]

#+begin_notes
Now, Alice and Bob are sending their respective certificates to each other instead of public keys. Even if Eve intercepts the certificate, she can't do anything because If Eve also has a certificate, the certificate will only show that it's Eve's public key and not Alice's. Therefore, Eve cannot impersonate Alice or Bob anymore.

If the website do not have a certificate issued by a CA, it could be a phishing website (钓鱼网站) or a legitimate website that hasn't yet applied for a certificate from the CA

A legitimate website without a certificate is still insecure. Your communication may be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack. You should not send any sensitive information, such as passwords.

#+BEGIN_NOTES
Now back to our example, what does "Certificate is not valid" mean? It means that the website doesn't have a certificate issued by a CA. it could be a phishing website, such as a fake Baidu website. Alternatively, it could be a legitimate website that hasn't yet applied for a certificate from the CA. However, even if it is a legitimate website, your communication is not secure. This puts you at risk of a man-in-the-middle attack. While you think you are communicating with the website server, it is possible that you are communicating with a man-in-the-middlebut. Therefore, even if you are certain that the website is legitimate, you should not send any sensitive information, such as passwords.
